# Legacy (non-production) helpers

This folder contains legacy or experimental helpers that are **not used in the main production flow**.
They are kept for compatibility with older tests or debugging utilities.

- `streaming_support.py`: legacy streaming UI/callback utilities (used only by legacy tests).
