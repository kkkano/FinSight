# FinSight Logo Options (More 10)

These 10 variations intentionally lean into the project’s real differentiators: multi-agent orchestration, streaming UX, deep research/RAG, alerts, and enterprise-grade reliability. They also reflect your personal engineering/automation bias (workflow clarity, integration, robustness).

11) 11_circuit_s — A circuit/workflow ‘S’ trace with colored nodes. Conveys routing + orchestration + integrations (your automation background) while keeping the mark abstract and scalable.

12) 12_report_stack — Layered report cards with section bars + confidence bar. Directly maps to FinSight’s structured report output and “professional-grade” UI story.

13) 13_stream_to_report — Three token streams feeding a report page. Represents SSE/token streaming and the end-to-end pipeline from signals → synthesis → deliverable.

14) 14_alert_bell_chart — A notification bell with trend line + risk marker. Fits Phase 3 “active service” direction (price/news alerts + risk awareness).

15) 15_integration_bridge — Two endpoints connected by an arc with a central hub. Visual shorthand for multi-source fallback + backend integration + Supervisor as the stable bridge.

16) 16_modular_tiles — Center tile + six surrounding modules. Highlights modular agents and a strong core coordinator; works well for explaining architecture at a glance.

17) 17_compass_search — Magnifier + compass needle. Signals deep research (search), direction (decision support), and “finding signal in noise”.

18) 18_f_barchart — A bold ‘F’ built from bars inside a solid tile. Highly icon-friendly; merges brand initial with finance semantics.

19) 19_signal_wave_candles — A signal waveform intersecting candlesticks. Communicates multi-signal fusion (news/macro/tech) and the “insight” layer over raw market movement.

20) 20_minimal_cutout — A minimal solid tile with negative-space lens and chart. Enterprise-clean, app-icon ready, and emphasizes “insight through a lens” without clutter.
